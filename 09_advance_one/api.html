<!--
The xhr.onreadystatechange property is an event handler thatis called whenever the readyState property of theXMLHttpRequest changes. This is used to monitor the progressof the request.

â­•readyState Values:

The readyState property has five possible values:
0 (UNSENT): The request is not initialized.
1 (OPENED): The request has been set up (i.e., open has been called).
2 (HEADERS_RECEIVED): The request has been sent and the headers have been received.
3 (LOADING): The response is being downloaded (i.e., responseText holds partial data).
4 (DONE): The request is complete, and the response is fully received.

<!-- 
Is console.log is the part of JavaScript: So console.log will come from the code of C++ which is written in the v8 GitHub repository file path is v8/src/d8/d8-console.cc; so this path of file where the code of console.log is written in the C++ language. So that is the main place where it found so technically it is not the part of js. 

There is so many thing which we use in js which are not the complete part of the js and they written in v8 engine repository in C++.
