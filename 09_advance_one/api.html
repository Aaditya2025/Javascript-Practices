<!-- 
Is console.log is the part of JavaScript: So console.log will come from the code of C++ which is written in the v8 GitHub repository file path is v8/src/d8/d8-console.cc; so this path of file where the code of console.log is written in the C++ language. So that is the main place where it found so technically it is not the part of js. 

There is so many thing which we use in js which are not the complete part of the js and they written in v8 engine repository in C++.
